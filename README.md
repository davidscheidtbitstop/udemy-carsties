This is my journey through the Udemy course:
'Build a Microservices app with .Net and NextJS from scratch' 

https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-microservices-app-with-dotnet-and-nextjs-from-scratch/

I am making a couple of changes to the code as I go through.
#1 Change to minimal APIs instead of controllers
#2 replace Moq in the testing with NSubstitute
#3 replace the NextJs website with a blazor website (fingers crossed on this one)
